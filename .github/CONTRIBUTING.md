# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. Before contributing please read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) &
[search the issue tracker](https://github.com/HospitalRun/components/issues); your issue
may have already been discussed or fixed in `master`. 

To contribute,
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo, commit your changes,
& [send a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Working on an Issue
In order to optimize the workflow and to prevent multiple contributors working on the same issue without interactions, a contributor must ask to be assigned to an issue by one of the core team members: it's enough to ask it inside the specific issue.

## Contributing to components

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local device
2. Navigate to the cloned folder: `cd components`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run `npm link` to link the local repo to the global npm folder
5. Run `npm run dev` to build and watch for code changes
6. In another terminal window create a [new react project](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) with `npx create-react-app my-app`‌
7. Navigate (`cd my-app`) to your react project and install [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass): `npm install -D node-sass`. Components styles are coded using scss and you need this dependency in order to successfully import components' `.scss` files
8. Link the components repo inside your newly created react project with `npm link components`
9. Start your react project with `npm start` and enjoy hot reloading when applying changes in the components repo
